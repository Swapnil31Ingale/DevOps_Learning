# 🌟 DevOps Learning Journey 🌟

Welcome to my **DevOps Learning** repository! 🚀

I'm documenting my journey of learning **DevOps** through hands-on projects and tutorials. Each topic will have its own folder, where I’ll keep adding learnings, notes, and code. Currently, I’m diving deep into **Docker** 🔥, and soon I will be adding more topics like **CI/CD**, **Kubernetes**, **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **Observability**, and more!

Stay tuned as I learn and grow! 🌱

---

### 🛠️ Topics I’m Learning:
- 🐳 **Docker**: Containerization and working with Docker images, volumes, and networks.
- 🚀 **CI/CD**: Automating builds, tests, and deployments.
- ☸️ **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration, deploying apps, and scaling workloads.
- ⚙️ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Automating infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible, etc.
- 📊 **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, and tracing using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack.

---

### 📂 Folder Structure:
In this repo, I will keep a folder for each topic. For example, for **Docker**, I have a folder called `Docker/` where I document my learning.

- `Docker/`: All Docker-related content, including images, Compose files, and use cases.
- `CI_CD/`: CI/CD pipelines, automating deployments, and testing.
- `Kubernetes/`: Kubernetes concepts and configurations.
- `IAC/`: Infrastructure automation with tools like Terraform and Ansible.
- `Observability/`: Tools and practices to monitor and log applications in production.

### 🤖 CI/CD with GitHub Actions 🚀
I’ve set up **GitHub Actions** to automate my workflows! Now every time I push code to the `main` branch, a GitHub Action automatically builds and pushes Docker images to Docker Hub. 🛠️
